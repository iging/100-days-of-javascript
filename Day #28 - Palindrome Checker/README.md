# Palindrome Checker

A sleek, modern web application that checks if a given text is a palindrome.

## 📝 Description

This Palindrome Checker is a simple yet elegant web application that allows users to determine whether a text input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## 🔑 Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, dark-themed modern design for easy readability
- **Instant Feedback**: Visual indication of palindrome status with color coding
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Accepts a variety of inputs including letters, numbers, and special characters
- **Smart Validation**: Ignores spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity when determining palindromes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The project consists of three core files:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and user interface elements
- **CSS**: Implements a modern, responsive dark theme design
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for palindrome checking and user interaction

### Palindrome Algorithm

The palindrome checking algorithm:

1. Removes all non-alphanumeric characters
2. Converts text to lowercase
3. Compares the cleaned string with its reverse

## 📋 Usage

1. Enter any text in the input field
2. Click the "Check" button
3. View the result with color-coded feedback:
   - Green for palindromes
   - Red for non-palindromes

## 📊 Examples of Palindromes

- "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama"
- "race car"
- "never odd or even"
- "0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0"

## 🧪 Testing

The application has been thoroughly tested to handle various scenarios including:

- Empty inputs
- Single character inputs
- Inputs with special characters
- Complex palindromic phrases
- Non-palindromic text

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- History of checked words
- Share results via social media
- Copy results to clipboard
- Support for checking palindromes in multiple languages
